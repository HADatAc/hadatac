The goal of this repository is to promote the secondary analysis of pooled environmental health data by providing data in a manner that is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. The repository is searchable by a number of features and users are able to compile and download customized datasets from CHEAR and HHEAR research studies. </p><p>To begin searching/browsing CHEAR/HHEAR data, please use the “Search Data & Request Dataset” button. </p><p>A link to tutorials on browsing, downloading and accessing data from the repository can be found below under Documentation.</p><p>To report any problems, please email hhearsupport@mssm.edu.</p>"
